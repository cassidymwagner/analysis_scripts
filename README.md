Collection of analysis and plotting scripts for calculating structure functions and spectral fluxes from various ocean surface velocity/scalar datasets. Relies on my structure function package, [Oceans SF](https://github.com/cassidymwagner/oceans_sf/).

Includes a couple of testing methods when I was troubleshooting speed problems.
